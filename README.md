   The vast majority of people these days are facing a whirlwind of panic and confusion in the wake of this pandemic. As the death toll from the coronavirus climbs day by day, a phenomenon called the Placebo Effect is taking place, in which individuals self diagnose themselves out of fear because of the diagnoses going on all around them. Irregular breathing rates are one of the top three symptoms found in COVID-19 patients; however, there is no efficient system yet to track them on the market without putting doctors at risk of person to person transmission. If more data were to be provided to scared individuals, they would be more likely to contact their primary care physicians and discuss any symptoms with them instead of making rash decisions.  

   Keeping this solvable problem in mind, we designed Ponoa, a respiratory monitoring system meant to replace baseless assumptions with solid evidence. Ponoa has two main components: a band which connects to any IOS/Android device via Bluetooth and an app which can be downloaded on any mobile phone or computer. Using it is so simple that even your 85 year old grandma would become a whiz in no time! The app will first record your baseline breathing rate once you activate the device and sync it to the app. Each time you use Ponoa, the app will record your current breathing rate for one minute and compare it against the baseline rate. If your breathing rate has deviated too far from its regular range, the app will alert you, as well as your primary care physician. As a result, you and your doctor will be able to discuss the change in breathing rate and plans for going forward, including getting tested for COVID-19 or potential medical treatments if needed.

  With the numerous discrepancies in our current health care system which dishes out differing treatments to individuals based on their ability to pay, Ponoa is a simple, cheap mechanism. Customers will easily choose a healthcare monitoring system that does not empty their pockets instead of spending hundreds of dollars out of pocket for a The device itself costs about $15.00 to manufacture and the final price for consumers is $29.99. If it were to be developed, Ponoa will theoretically be available on Amazon and be able to be shipped out to any location, as well as being found at Walmart stores across the nation. Users will find Ponoa convenient and easy to find.
  
  The creation of Ponoa involved numerous software platforms, including Autodesk CAD, Arduino, Atom, Appery.io, and Assembly. Lucas planned out its design through the use of Autodesk CAD and constructed its features. Furthermore, he wrote a plethora of baseline code for the device using Arduino as a demo of how the device would function in real life. Amanda built the website using Atom and formed Ponoa's logo on Assembly, an iPad vector design app. Moreover, she attempted to outline part of what the app would appear to users on Appery.io, however, she did not yet have the experience with building apps to program out exactly how it would operate. If we were to have more time, we would pinpoint our focus on further developing the app and exploring marketing options for the device. Despite these setbacks, we did our best to deliver a product that is accessible, pragmatic, and straightforward. 
  
  We are extremely open to developing Ponoa post-hackathon and are excited about what we've built so far. The product we've designed has the chance to curb misinformation and guide users on the path towards making wise decisions regarding their personal health. All we can say is, the sky's the limit when it comes to Ponoa's possibilities.
