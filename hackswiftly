            entrepreneurship, and a lifetime of self-learning within the U.S. education system. Join a dedicated community of over 1,000 professional
            educators nationwide who strive to build a foundation of knowledge in their students. We recently were honored to be named the 2020 Finalist
            and Winner of the Investing in Innovation federal grant. </h3>

          alt="girl looking at laptop, her head being filled with ideas"></center>With 132,853 K-12 schools nationwide, America has unlimited potential. However, the current school system isn't
          reinforcing the skills needed for the 21st Century at all. Overcrowded classrooms, income inequality, and unqualified teachers mark just some of
          the problems within our education system. We face a turning point where we must make a decision. Do we stay complacent with the current status quo,
          or do we strive to give our children the best education they can possibly get? </h3>

          <h3>We don't just teach kids how to learn. We inspire them to learn <i>why</i> they learn. Unlike traditional schools, our curriculum
          incorporates the holistic development of our students first and foremost. Healthy Relationships, Self Awareness, Skepticism, and Logic & Reasoning
          are our 4 core classes because we believe that healthy, educated youth will grow up to be passionate, action-oriented adults. Opportunities here are
          simply unparalleled. From research internships in our biology course to machine learning competitions in our A.I. centered class, students are exposed to curriculum
          applications in the real world like never before. Every single one of our programs is designed to minimize cost so that <i>all</i> students are
          able to access them, with a particular focus on scholarships for students from low-income families. Each one of our educators is certified by the National
          Teaching Association and has at least a master's degree in teaching. We recruit from the top graduate schools across the country for education,
          most notably Harvard University, UPenn, and Johns Hopkins. Here at Innovation Education, we place people over profit. </h3>

            We have partnered with the U.S. Department of Education to begin our test runs in more than 50 K-12 schools across Illinois and Mississippi.
          Evidence conducted by Niche has shown that Innovation students learn about 30% more material compared to their tradionally schooled peers - and
          the difference shows! By the end of 2022, we plan to expand into 12 states, with over 3,000 schools nationwide showing interest in our program.</h3>
